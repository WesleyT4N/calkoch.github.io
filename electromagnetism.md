title: About Electromagnetic Braking
---
The idea of using an electromagnet as a brake has been mainly used in large vehicles and machines. There are several main types, most of which rely on using magnetism to move a mechanical part or parts. The mechanical part can then be used to produce friction with a moving part, thereby reducing speed. However, this process is rather inefficient. Electromagnets can also be used to make frictionless brakes which is what we are interested in. Further, we are interested in reducing the rotation of a bicycle wheel and hence, angular velocity. Thus, the desired brake involves dissipating rotational energy. In theory, if a magnetic field is induced in a rotating disc, it will produce eddy currents within the disc. These currents will then oppose the rotation of the disc by dissipating kinetic energy in the form of heat (causing the temperature of the disc to increase).

To me, this concept did not seem intuitive, so I decided to test it. The magnetic field is usually generated by an electromagnet. Hence, I was interested in knowing if an electromagnet could really affect the rotation of the wheel. Also, I wanted to determine whether increasing the voltage running through the electromagnet would cause a larger retarding force. The latter test may seem obvious, but I felt it was necessary to validate the concept experimentally before making any conclusions.
