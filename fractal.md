title: About Fractal Geometry
---

<span style="color:#f2f2f0">
My research with fractals began with an initial school project where I designed my own unique fractal. I found it interesting to
explore the geometric properties of the fractal and how it maintained regularity over infinite generations. After writing a paper regarding this fractal, I began studying the Koch snowflake and extracted a methodology from its development. The second paper is about this methodology and its application to other fractals.
