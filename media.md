<h2>Nature of this page</h2>

<span style="color:#f2f2f0">
This page includes links to videos or articles in which I appeared or which relate to my activities. Mostly, they relate to competitions, awards, scholarships, or other activities I've been involved with.

As I worked through the diploma program, I couldn't help but wish that I could see other students' work as examples on which I could model my own work. Also, for certain essays - especially in psychology - it was difficult at times to find appropriate, open-source primary documents. I am using this page to solve these problems for future students. I have posted every essay I wrote during the IB program, organized by subject. In addition, I've posted my EE in mathematics, and my internal assessment papers. As I get the marks for these papers, I will post them too so that the reader can get an idea of their relative quality from the perspective of an IB grader.
