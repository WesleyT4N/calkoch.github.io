title: Comparative Analysis of Discharge Rate and Gage Height
---

<span style="color:#f2f2f0">
As a part of my contribution to the Group 4 project for IB biology HL, I conducted an analysis of Dan River data. I looked at the relationship between gage height and discharge rate. All of my work can be found at our [Group 4 project website](https://sites.google.com/a/mail.dps.k12.va.us/dan-river/) under the section titled "Data analysis."
