<span style="color:#f2f2f0">
I analyzed data from various biological suveys conducted in Anglers Park, Virginia. I looked at three specific surveys in 2008, 2010,
and 2015, with respect to observations of amphibians and reptiles. _A. americanus_, _D. fuscus_, _E. cirrigera_, and _N. sipedon_ were
four species that indicated the relative biodiversity of the park. The biodiversity index was calculated using the inverse Simpson index.
