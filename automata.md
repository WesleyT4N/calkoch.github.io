<span style="color:#C6E2FF">
With cellular automata (CA), I have mainly focused on the evolution of an nxn square in Conwayâ€™s Game of Life.  I've developed simulation programs to search for certain patterns. Some of these can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/cakoch10/Patterns_in_Game_of_Life).
