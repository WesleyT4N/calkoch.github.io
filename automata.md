<span style="color:#f2f2f0">
How predictable is cellular automaton behavior in Conway's Game of Life (GoL)?  My research is driven by this question, and I believe there are three general steps leading to an answer.
</span>

> 1. <span style="color:#f2f2f0">Identify a pattern in GoL</span>
> 2. <span style="color:#f2f2f0">Mathematically prove that this pattern continues indefinitely</span>
> 3. <span style="color:#f2f2f0">Conclude that GoL is more predictable than previously regarded</span>

<span style="color:#f2f2f0">
I've already written a paper on step 1. Soon, I plan on publishing two papers fulfilling step 2. Of course, 3 follows directly from 2, so it can be addressed in the same papers adressing 2.
</span>

<span style="color:#f2f2f0">
To derive the proof referenced in 2, I've developed a model that can give (with limited information about the start state) the most probable behavior of a cellular automaton. Ideally, this model can then be used to show that a pattern most likely continues indefinitely. I am still working on that last part though.
