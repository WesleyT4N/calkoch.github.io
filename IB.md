title: The IB Diploma Program

##Background

<span style="color:#f2f2f0">
During the last two years of high school, I completed the [IB diploma program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IB_Diploma_Programme). I took three HL (higher level) courses: biology, English, and history and three SL (standard level) courses: mathematics, psychology, and Spanish. The only IB class at my school that I did not take was IB theater (SL). Hence, I was extremely limited in the courses I could take. As part of the diploma program I also took the [theory of knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_knowledge_(IB_course)) course and completed an Extended Essay.

I completed this project for school. It was the individual investigation for IB Biology HL. The article I wrote documenting the major results is embedded below.
