title: The IB Diploma Program
---

<span style="color:#f2f2f0">
During the last two years of high school, I completed the [IB diploma program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IB_Diploma_Programme). I took
three HL (higher level) courses: Biology, English, and History and three SL (standard level) courses: Mathematics, Psychology, and Spanish.
The only IB class at my school that I did not take was IB Theater (SL). Hence, I was extremely limited in the courses I could take. As part
of the diploma program I also took Theory of Knowledge and completed an Extended Essay.

I completed this project for school. It was the individual investigation for IB Biology HL. The article I wrote documenting the major results is embedded below.
