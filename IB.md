title: The IB Diploma Program
---

<h2>Background</h2>

<span style="color:#f2f2f0">
During the last two years of high school, I completed the [IB diploma program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IB_Diploma_Programme). I took three HL (higher level) courses: biology, English, and history and three SL (standard level) courses: mathematics, psychology, and Spanish. The only IB class at my school that I did not take was IB theater (SL). Hence, I was extremely limited in the courses I could take. As part of the diploma program I also took the [theory of knowledge (TOK)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_knowledge_(IB_course)) course and completed an Extended Essay.

<h2>Nature of this page</h2>

<span style="color:#f2f2f0">
During these two years, I wrote countless essays and spent countless hours thinking about problems within the disciplines mentioned above. Most of these essays originated from psychology, TOK, English, and history.

As I worked through the diploma program, I couldn't help but wish that I could see other students' work as examples on which I could model my own work. Also, for certain essays - especially in psychology - it was difficult at times to find appropriate, open-source primary sources. I am using this page to solve these problems for future students. I have posted every essay I wrote during the IB program, organized by subject. In addition, I've posted my Extended Essay in Mathematics, and my internal assessment papers. As I get the marks for these papers, I will post them too so that the reader can get an idea of their relative quality from the perspective of an IB grader.
