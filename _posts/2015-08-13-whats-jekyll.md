title: Welcome to my personal website!

<span style="color:#f2f2f0">
I made this website as a place where I can group together some relevant links and information pertaining to my projects, research, and papers. To the left you can find links to my past papers, coding projects, mobile app, and Instructables articles. This website is hosted by GitHub and can be found [here](https://github.com/cakoch10/cakoch10.github.io).

<!--
[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) <span style="color:#f2f2f0"> is a static site generator, an open-source tool for creating simple yet powerful websites of all shapes and sizes. From </span> [the project's readme](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/blob/master/README.markdown):

  > Jekyll is a simple static site generator. It takes a template directory [...] and spits out a complete, static website suitable for serving with Apache or your favorite web server. This is also the engine behind GitHub Pages, which you can use to host your projectâ€™s page or blog right here from Github.
