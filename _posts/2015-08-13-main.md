<span style="color:#f2f2f0">
I made this website as a place for grouping together some relevant links and information pertaining to my projects, research, and writing. To the left are the main links which are discussed below. The source code for this website is available [online](https://github.com/cakoch10/cakoch10.github.io). Click on the header of a project for more information (note: this only applies to some project headers). I will be adding more content soon.

<h2>Projects</h2>

<span style="color:#f2f2f0">
I have been actively involved in various research projects mainly in the area of mathematics and computer science. The link to the left leads to my ResearchGate profile. The two main projects on which I am currently working involve cellular automata and electromagnetic braking.

[Cellular Automata](/automata)

<span style="color:#f2f2f0">
With cellular automata (CA), I have mainly focused on the evolution of an nxn square in Conwayâ€™s Game of Life.  I've developed simulation programs to search for certain patterns. Some of these can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/cakoch10/Patterns_in_Game_of_Life).

<h3>Chemistry Made Easy</h3>

<span style="color:#f2f2f0">
This project began as a simple concept developed in 2014 at NC State's Engineering Summer Program in Computer Science. The app is designed as a chemistry calculator to solve formulaic problems. I have been meaning to update its functionality but have not yet gotten the chance. It has been published on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=appinventor.ai_cakoch10.ChemistryMadeEasy).

<h3>Ornithopters</h3>
<span style="color:#f2f2f0">
Here is a video of me flying an ornithopter at the NIA (I built the tail on this one). If you are unable to view the video, you can download the [mp4 file](https://github.com/cakoch10/cakoch10.github.io/blob/master/public/OrnithopterFlight.mp4?raw=true).

[Fractal geometry](/fractal)

<span style="color:#f2f2f0">
I have written a few papers on fractal geometry. They have mainly dealt with or related to the Koch Snowflake.
</span>

[Electromagnetic Braking](/electromagnetism)

<span style="color:#f2f2f0">
Some of my research has involved the research and development of compact electromagnetic braking methods, speciifcally in relation to bicycles.
</span>

[Biodiversity of Anglers Park](/bio)

<span style="color:#f2f2f0">
I conducted a biological study to determine the relative change in the biodiversity of a local park. This research study has amounted to a small research article and combines statistical analysis with environmental science.
