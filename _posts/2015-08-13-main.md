<span style="color:#f2f2f0">
I made this website as a place for grouping together some relevant links and information pertaining to my projects, research, and writing. To the left are the main links which are discussed below. The source code for this website is available [online](https://github.com/cakoch10/cakoch10.github.io). Click on the header of a project for more information (note: this only applies to some project headers). I will be adding more content soon.

#Projects
<span style="color:#f2f2f0">
I have been actively involved in various research projects mainly in the area of mathematics and computer science. The link to the left leads to my ResearchGate profile. The two main projects on which I am currently working involve cellular automata and electromagnetic braking.

##[Cellular Automata](/automata)
<span style="color:#f2f2f0">
With cellular automata (CA), I have mainly focused on the evolution of an nxn square in Conwayâ€™s Game of Life.  I've developed simulation programs to search for certain patterns. Some of these can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/cakoch10/Patterns_in_Game_of_Life).

##Chemistry Made Easy

This project began as a simple concept developed in 2014 at NC State's Engineering Summer Program in Computer Science. The app is designed as a chemistry calculator to solve formulaic problems. I have been meaning to update its functionality but have not yet gotten the chance. It has been published on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=appinventor.ai_cakoch10.ChemistryMadeEasy).

##Ornithopters

Here is a video of me flying an ornithopter at the NIA (I built the tail on this one). If you are unable to view the video, you can download the [mp4 file](https://github.com/cakoch10/cakoch10.github.io/blob/master/public/OrnithopterFlight.mp4?raw=true).
