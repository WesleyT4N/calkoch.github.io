title: Welcome to my personal website!

<span style="color:#f2f2f0">
I made this website as a place where I can group together some relevant links and information pertaining to my projects, research, and writing. To the left you can find links to my past papers, coding projects, mobile app, and Instructables articles. The source code for this website can be found [here](https://github.com/cakoch10/cakoch10.github.io). I will be adding more content soon.

#Projects
<span style="color:#f2f2f0">
I have been actively involved in various research projects mainly in the area of mathematics and computer science. The link to the left leads to my ResearchGate profile. The two main projects on which I am currently working involve cellular automata and electromagnetic braking.

##Cellular Automata
<span style="color:#f2f2f0">
With cellular automata (CA), I have mainly focused on the evolution of an nxn square in Conway’s Game of Life.  I've developed simulation programs to search for certain patterns. Some of these can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/cakoch10/Patterns_in_Game_of_Life). I initially found that as the value of n increases the number of generations taken to reach a still life also increases. The trend resembles this graph

<span style="color:#f2f2f0">
Proving that this trend continues indefinetly is tricky and is something that I am working towards via the developlment of a probabilstic model. My ultimate goal is to show that the behavior of an automaton in Game of Life is predictable to a certain extent.

##Chemistry Made Easy

This project began as a simple concept developed in 2014 at NC State's Engineering Summer Program in Computer Science. The app is designed as a chemistry calculator to solve formulaic problems. I have been meaning to update its functionality but have not yet gotten the chance. It has been published on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=appinventor.ai_cakoch10.ChemistryMadeEasy).

<!--
[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) <span style="color:#f2f2f0"> is a static site generator, an open-source tool for creating simple yet powerful websites of all shapes and sizes. From </span> [the project's readme](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/blob/master/README.markdown):

  > Jekyll is a simple static site generator. It takes a template directory [...] and spits out a complete, static website suitable for serving with Apache or your favorite web server. This is also the engine behind GitHub Pages, which you can use to host your project’s page or blog right here from Github.

##Ornithopters
<span style="color:#f2f2f0">
Here's a video of me flying an ornithopter at the NIA (I built the tail on this one).
