title: Welcome to my personal website!

<span style="color:#f2f2f0">
I made this website as a place where I can group together some relevant links and information pertaining to my projects, research, and writing. To the left you can find links to my past papers, coding projects, mobile app, and Instructables articles. The source code for this website can be found [here](https://github.com/cakoch10/cakoch10.github.io). I will be adding more content soon.

#Projects
I have been actively involved in various research projects mainly in the area of mathematics and computer science. The link to the left leads to my ResearchGate profile. The two main projects on which I am currently working involve cellular automata and electromagnetic braking.




<!--
[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) <span style="color:#f2f2f0"> is a static site generator, an open-source tool for creating simple yet powerful websites of all shapes and sizes. From </span> [the project's readme](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/blob/master/README.markdown):

  > Jekyll is a simple static site generator. It takes a template directory [...] and spits out a complete, static website suitable for serving with Apache or your favorite web server. This is also the engine behind GitHub Pages, which you can use to host your projectâ€™s page or blog right here from Github.
